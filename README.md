# JetBrains MCP Proxy Server

The server proxies requests from client to JetBrains IDE.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.
The full path on MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, on Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jetbrains": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jetbrains/mcp-proxy"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're running multiple IDEs with MCP server and want to connect to the specific one, add to the MCP server configuration:

  "IDE_PORT": "<port of built-in webserver>"
}
```
